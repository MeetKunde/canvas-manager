## Name
Canvas Manager

## Description
C++ library compiled into WebAssemly which can be used in a web application written in JavaScript or TypeScript. 
It is used to manage the process of creating various geometric figures - points, segments, lines, semi-lines, circles or polygons and setting dependencies - parallelims, perpendicularity, segments and angles equality and angle and segment lengths. 
It contains a custom implementation of all the necessary objects for this purpose.
The most attractive part of this solution are the algorithms that find and solve the common points of figures. 
The library does not include a graphical interface for drawing figures and displaying the results. It provides functions matching the relevant events and calls the passed drawing functions itself.
